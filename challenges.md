# Challenges

1. Try to make the hands faster - what about a millisecond hand?

1. Could we make the clock into stopwatch style counter?

1. Could we draw differently? What about different colors? How would they work?

1. How would we make the clock look better? Could we add numbers around the boundary to make it more readable?

1. How can we automate testing to see if the clock functions as expected - unit testing perhaps?
